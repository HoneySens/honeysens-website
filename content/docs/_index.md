## The HoneySens Project


HoneySens is a honeypot management platform that supports the deployment of various open source honeypots on a variety of hardware and software architectures. This page is primarily about the freely available [Community Edition](/releases/ce). In case you're interested in professional support, please have a look at the [Enterprise Edition](/releases/enterprise).

The following topics are meant to give an introduction into the HoneySens design goals, architecture, setup procedure and operation.
