Traditional defenses in IT security try to detect and mitigate threats as fast and efficient as possible in an attempt to reduce damage to infrastructure, assets and confidential data. Anti-virus software and Intrusion Detection Systems are widespread examples for that. However, there exists another and - at the first look - quite contrary approach: deception. Instead of combating potential intruders with full force, one could try to lure them into attacking seemingly vulnerable systems that are in fact heavily monitored and may give away the intentions and practices of an attacker. Such systems are simply called *honeypots* in remembrance of bears that often are drawn to honey.
