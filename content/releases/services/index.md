Honeypot services that simulate network services and detect conspicuous behavior can be downloaded from here.

<!--more-->
Each service is available for two different architectures: *amd64* for dockerized and *armhf* for BeagleBone Black sensors. Make sure all downloaded files match their linked SHA1 checksums.
