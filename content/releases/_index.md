HoneySens initially started out as a diploma thesis and emerged later into a joint project between the [Technische Universität Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de), [SID](https://www.sid.sachsen.de) (Staatsbetrieb Sächsische Informatik Dienste) and [T-Systems Multimedia Solutions](https://www.t-systems-mms.com/). For a limited time period, we offered a feature-reduced *Community Edition* (CE) and a commercial variant with all available features in parallel. Starting in 2025 we decided to merge both versions, open-sourcing the whole project and maintaining it publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/HoneySens/honeysens).
