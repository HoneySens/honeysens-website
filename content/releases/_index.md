HoneySens initially started out as a diploma thesis and emerged later into a joint project between the [Technische Universität Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de), [SID](https://www.sid.sachsen.de) (Staatsbetrieb Sächsische Informatik Dienste) and [T-Systems Multimedia Solutions](https://www.t-systems-mms.com/). This page offers downloads for the freely available Community Edition (CE), which ships with a limited number of honeypot services and currently only supports deployment on BeagleBone devices. The Community Edition forms the basis for the commercial distribution of HoneySens, which can be obtained from T-Systems Multimedia Solutions. With each new release, features from the commercial version are backported to the Community Edition.
